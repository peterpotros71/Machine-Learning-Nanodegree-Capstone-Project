## Starbucks capstone project 
    Our project aims at identifying a criterion upon which Starbucks will be sending offers to its customers and predicting how they will respond to different offers depending on hidden traits of customers and which cluster is most likely to accept each offer from the following: buy-one-get-one (BOGO), discount, and informational. This helps perform better prediction of which offer is most likely to excite each of our clients individually.
